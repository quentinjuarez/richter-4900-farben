# 🎨 Gerhard Richter — _4900 Farben_ (Interactive Simulation)

A digital, code-based interpretation of **Gerhard Richter’s 2007 artwork _4900 Farben_**, built as an interactive web experience.  
This simulation reconstructs the **196 industrial color charts** (each a 5×5 grid) and the final **70×70 arrangement**, following the artist’s logic of chance, color systems, and algorithmic distribution.

## ⭐ About the Project

This project aims to recreate — as faithfully as digital media allows — the structure and generative method behind **Gerhard Richter’s _4900 Farben_**:

- 196 panels (each 5 × 5)
- Assembled into a 70 × 70 grid
- Colors following an **industrial paint-chart logic**, not “artistic mixing”
- Distribution generated using **pseudo-random algorithms**, echoing Richter’s use of computer randomization
- A manually curated palette approximating **the richness, density, and variation** of the original enamel colors

This is **not** a reproduction of copyrighted images — it is a **simulation**, based on code, logic, and publicly documented working methods.

## 🧠 Features

- 💠 **Fully responsive** canvas
- 🎲 **Random seed** regeneration with `Space` or click
- 📐 **70 × 70 grid**, matching the artwork's final configuration
- 🎨 **196-color industrial-style palette**, hand-crafted to reflect Richter’s color logic
- ✨ Subtle per-cell variations to simulate enamel irregularities
- 🧩 Modular code structure (Vue 3 + Vite)

## 🖼️ Artwork Logic

The simulation respects Richter’s methodology:

- Colors are drawn from a **fixed palette of 196 tones**
- Each square receives a color with a slight controlled variation
- Panels can theoretically be rearranged (as in the real work)
- The final assembly forms a **4900-square color field**

The project focuses on **faithfulness to method**, not photographic reproduction.
